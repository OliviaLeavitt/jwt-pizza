# Incident Report – 2025-12-05

## Summary

On **December 5, 2025**, from about **8:00 AM to 2:00 PM**, users were unable to complete orders in the JWT Pizza app. When attempting to pay, they received a **500 Internal Server Error**, and the UI displayed a support log link generated by the Pizza Factory service:

**`https://pizza-factory.cs329.click/api/support/aa1f2394f07c427f8ede92415ad39bfb/report/t9xnjzwh`**

This happened because I scheduled a **chaos test** the day before. During the chaos window, the Pizza Factory service intentionally failed all fulfillment requests. Since JWT Pizza depends on that service, all checkout attempts failed.

The chaos test was **fixed on December 8, 2025**, so future runs will no longer cause prolonged outages.

## Detection

I discovered the issue when I tried to place an order myself and saw:

- A **500 Internal Server Error** in the browser console  
- A **Pizza Factory support log link** in the console output  

Opening the support link confirmed that the vendor was failing requests intentionally.

**Future detection improvements:**

- Add a periodic automated test order.  
- Add internal monitoring specifically for Pizza Factory failures.

---

## Impact

- **All users** attempting to place orders between **8:00 AM and 2:00 PM** were unable to complete checkout.  
- No orders were fulfilled during this period.  
- No support tickets were filed because this failure was expected during the chaos exercise.

## Timeline (Local Time)

| Time | Event |

| **Dec 4, 8:00 AM** | Chaos test began; Pizza Factory started failing requests. |
| **Shortly after 8:00 AM** | Saw 500 error + support log link in browser console when placing an order. |
| **8:00 AM – 2:00 PM** | All order fulfillment attempts failed. |

## Response

1. Checked browser console.  
2. Followed the Pizza Factory support link.  
3. Verified the failures were caused by the chaos test.  
4. No action was needed on JWT Pizza’s side.  
5. On **Dec 8**, updated and corrected the chaos test configuration.

---

## Root Cause

The root cause was the **intentional chaos test**.  
During the chaos window, the Pizza Factory vendor service rejected all fulfillment requests, causing JWT Pizza to return 500 errors.

---

## Prevention

- Add vendor-specific alerts for Pizza Factory failures.  
- Improve dashboards to show external service performance.  
- Add an automated test-order probe.  
- Update the playbook with steps for diagnosing vendor outages, including how to interpret support log links.  
- Ensure chaos tests are configured with **safety limits**, as applied on **Dec 8, 2025**.

---

## Action Items

1. Add vendor-specific failure alert.  
2. Improve dashboard panels for external services.  
3. Add a test-order probe for quicker detection.  
4. Update playbook with vendor-outage troubleshooting steps.  
5. Review chaos-testing procedures to prevent extended outages.
